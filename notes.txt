CELLULAR AUTOMATA

Wolfram's Classification:

Class 1:    Nearly all initial patterns evolve quickly into a stable, homogeneous state. 
            Any randomness in the initial pattern disappears.

Class 2:    Nearly all initial patterns evolve quickly into stable or oscillating structures. 
            Some of the randomness in the initial pattern may filter out, but some remains. 
            Local changes to the initial pattern tend to remain local.

Class 3:    Nearly all initial patterns evolve in a pseudo-random or chaotic manner. 
            Any stable structures that appear are quickly destroyed by the surrounding noise. 
            Local changes to the initial pattern tend to spread indefinitely.

Class 4:    Nearly all initial patterns evolve into structures that interact in complex and interesting ways, 
            with the formation of local structures that are able to survive for long periods of time.
