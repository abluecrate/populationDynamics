CELLULAR AUTOMATA

Wolfram's Classification:

Class 1:    Nearly all initial patterns evolve quickly into a stable, homogeneous state. 
            Any randomness in the initial pattern disappears.

Class 2:    Nearly all initial patterns evolve quickly into stable or oscillating structures. 
            Some of the randomness in the initial pattern may filter out, but some remains. 
            Local changes to the initial pattern tend to remain local.

Class 3:    Nearly all initial patterns evolve in a pseudo-random or chaotic manner. 
            Any stable structures that appear are quickly destroyed by the surrounding noise. 
            Local changes to the initial pattern tend to spread indefinitely.

Class 4:    Nearly all initial patterns evolve into structures that interact in complex and interesting ways, 
            with the formation of local structures that are able to survive for long periods of time.

DOG CURVES
(Predator Chasing Prey)

In geometry, a radiodrome is the pursuit curve followed by a point that is pursuing another linearly-moving point. 
The classic (and best-known) form of a radiodrome is known as the "dog curve"; 
this is the path a dog follows when it swims across a stream with a current after food it has spotted on the other side. 
Because the dog drifts downwards with the current, it will have to change its heading; 
it will also have to swim further than if it had computed the optimal heading.
